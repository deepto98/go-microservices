# go-microservices

Learning how to build Microservices in Go, from Trevor Sawler's  Working with Microservices in Go course

- front-end contains the UI to trigger the broker APIs
- broker-service contains the broker microservice
- docker-project contains the Makefile and docker-compose.yml
  
Running the Project:
- `make up_build `  to run broker app on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)  
- `make start ` to run front end on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
